<p>I will probably never switch to reading books in an electronic format
unless they become available in a universally readable format, unencumbered by
any sort of DRM or country-specific restrictions.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I read books primarily from the <a href="http://spl.org">
library</a>. Sometimes I buy books on the cheap from <a
href="http://abebooks.com">AbeBooks</a>, which I will give
away, eventually.</p>


<h2>To Read</h2>

<p>I currently keep a running list of books I want to read at <a
href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/deepakjois/books?category=wanted">BookJetty</a>.</p>

<h2>Read (since 2006)</h2>
