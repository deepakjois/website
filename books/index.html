<h1>Books</h1>

<p>I will probably never switch to reading books in an electronic format
unless they become available in a universally readable format, unencumbered by
any sort of DRM and country-specific restrictions. At the same time, I hate
buying books because either I do not have the budget for it, or I do not like
to accumulate more stuff.</p>

<p>So nowadays, I read books primarily from <a href="http://spl.org">the
library</a>. Sometimes I buy books on the cheap from <a
href="http://abebooks.com">AbeBooks</a>, which I eventually plan to give
away.</p>

<p>I started keeping track of books that I read since 2006.</p>
