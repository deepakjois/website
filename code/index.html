	  <h3>gchartrb</h3> <p><em>This project is in hibernation.</em>
	  You can fork the code on <a
	  href="http://github.com/deepakjois/gchartrb">GitHub</a> and do what you like
	  with it.</p>

	   <p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/gchartrb">gchartrb</a> is a Ruby
	  wrapper around the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/">Google Chart
	  API</a>. It is inspired by another Ruby based graphing library called <a
	  href="http://nubyonrails.com/pages/gruff">Gruff</a>. Visit the website for
	  more information.</p>

	   <h3>Tabbie</h3>
	   <p>Aditya Krishnan and me were the original creators of <a
	  href="http://tabbie.wikidot.com">Tabbie</a>, an open source Tab Software for
	  British Parliamentary style debating tournaments. It was first used in <a
	  href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg">NTU</a> Worlds 2004.</p>
	    <p>Apart from NTU Worlds 2004, Tabbie has been <a
	  href="http://tabbie.wikidot.com/customers">used in many tournaments</a>
	  around the world, including two World Universities Debating tournaments in
	  Vancouver (2006) and Bangkok (2008).</p>
	   <p>Klaas Van Schelven is the current maintainer for Tabbie.</p>

	  <h3 id="sicphaskell">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Exercises)</h3>
	  <p>
	   <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/" title="SICP Book Websitr">SICP</a> is 
	   a great book. Peter Norvig writes in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm" title="Amazon.com: Peter Norvig's review of Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs">review of the book</a>
	  </p>
	  
	  <blockquote><p>To use an analogy, if SICP were about automobiles, it would be
for the person who wants to know how cars work, how they are built, and how
one might design fuel-efficient, safe, reliable vehicles for the 21st century.
The people who hate SICP are the ones who just want to know how to drive their
car on the highway, just like everyone else.</p></blockquote>

    <p>I started reading SICP and decided to use <a
    href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell - HaskellWiki">Haskell</a>
    to do the exercises. I am putting up my <a href="http://github.com/deepakjois/sicphaskell/tree" title="deepakjois's sicphaskell at master - GitHub">solutions on github</a>.</p>
	  
	  
	  <h3 id="projecteuler">Project Euler Problems</h3>
	  <p>
	    I am using <a href="http://projecteuler.net/" title="Project Euler">Project Euler</a> to learn
	    <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell - HaskellWiki">Haskell</a>. I have put up some

	  <h3 id="twitterarchiver">TwitterArchiver</h3>
	   <p>
	     <a href="http://github.com/deepakjois/TwitterArchiver/tree/master" 
	        title="deepakjois's TwitterArchiver at master - GitHub">TwitterArchiver</a> is a 
	     script written in <a href="http://www.haskell.org/" title="Haskell - HaskellWiki">Haskell</a>.
	     It archives all your past Tweets in a JSON file. It also has the ability to
	     sync an already existing archive and update it with the latest feeds.

	   <p><a
	  href="http://jflickruploader.sourceforge.net/pyflickruploadr.html">PyFlickrUploadr</a>
	  is a Python script to upload photos to Flickr from the commandline. It has a
	  variety of things you can set from the command-line like tags, privacy level
	  etc.</p>

	  <h3 id='wallpaper'>Gnome Wallpaper Changer</h3>

	   <p><em>This code is no longer being maintained.</em></p>

	   <p>A long time ago I wrote a script to change/cycle wallpapers
	  automatically in Gnome on Ubuntu Linux. I put up the code on a <a
	  href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com/2005/10/gnome-wallpaper-switcher.html">post
	  on my old blog</a>. A couple of people even contributed a few variants to
	  it.</p>
