		master - GitHub">Jekyll</a>. The website codebase is <a href="http://github.com/deepakjois/website/tree/master" title="deepakjois's website at master - GitHub">hosted in Github</a> too.</p>

			<h2>Design</h2>

			<p>This site was designed in collaboration with <a
      href="http://nimbupani.com/" title="Nimbupani Designs - standards based
      css webdesign">Nimbupani Designs</a>.The primary goal of the design
      process was to keep things minimal. However, special attention was paid
      to the typography.</p>

			<p>Design inspiration came from the following sources:</p>

			<ul>
			  <li><a
  			href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063%3FSubscriptionId%3D1KWW0ZZBXM2H44SQVD02%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0881792063">The
  			Elements of Typographic Style</a> by Robert Bringhurst</li>

			<li><a
		href="http://diveintomark.org/" title="Dive into Mark">Dive into Mark</a> by Mark Pilgrim</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Some things I incorporated in the typography, which might be of interest :</p>
			
			<ul>
			 <li><a href="http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Vertical_Motion/2.2.2/" title="Add and delete vertical space in measured&nbsp;intervals | The Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web">Vertical Rhythm</a></li>

			 <li><a href="http://www.retinart.net/typography/marksunknown">Typographic Marks Unknown</a> (from where I picked up the hedera between the menu items)</li>
			</ul>

		 <h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>

		 <p>This site is tested with and optimized for Firefox, Safari and Opera. I try
     to make it readable in IE7. If you are using IE 6, donâ€˜t even bother
     visiting this site.</p>
