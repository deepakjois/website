		<h2>Software <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Coding</h2>

		<p>This site was created with the latest version of <a
		href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master" title="mojombo's jekyll at
		master - GitHub"q>Jekyll</a>. A Ruby script was used to fetch all the <a
		href="/books">book metadata</a> from Amazon.</p>

		<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5" title="HTML 5 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">HTML5</a> markup is used all throughout.</p>		
			<h2>Design</h2>

			<p>This site was designed in collaboration with <a
		href="http://nimbupani.com/" title="Nimbupani Designs - standards based css
		webdesign">Nimbupani Designs</a>.</p>

			<p>The primary goal of the design process was to keep things minimal. However,
			special attention was paid to the typography because I was inspired after
			reading <a
			href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063%3FSubscriptionId%3D1KWW0ZZBXM2H44SQVD02%26tag%3Dws%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0881792063">The
			Elements of Typographic Style</a>.</p>

			<p>More design inspiration came from the following sources:</p>

			<ul> 
				<li><a href="http://tomayko.com/writings/administrative-debris"
		title="Administrative Debris">Administrative Debris</a></li>
			<li><a
		href="http://diveintomark.org/" title="Dive into Mark">Dive into Mark</a></li>
			</ul>		
		 <h2>Browser Compatibility</h2>

		 <p>This site is tested with Firefox and Safari and is most optimised. I will
		occasionally test this site with Internet Explorer 7, but I can’t promise that
		you will have the most optimal experience.</p>
