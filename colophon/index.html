<h1>Colophon</h1>

<h2>Software <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Coding</h2>

<p>This site was created with the latest version of <a
href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master" title="mojombo's jekyll at
master - GitHub"q>Jekyll</a>. A Ruby script was used to fetch all the <a
href="/books">books info</a> from Amazon.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5" title="HTML 5 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">HTML5</a> markup is used all throughout.</p>


<h2>Design</h2>

<p>The primary goal of the design process was to keep things minimal.
However, special attention was paid to the typography because I was
heavily inspired by <a

Elements of Typographic Style</a>.</p>

<p>Other design inspirations came from the following sources –</p>
