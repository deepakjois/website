My favourite chapters in the book are the last two where the authors take about human expansion, and the extraordinary intelligence of the Ashkenazi.

The book was a bit dense in the parts where the authors deal with core genetics, and start talking about alleles. But I think the reader can safely skip those parts and still gain some interesting insights."

I really like non-sensationalist approach that le Carre takes in buiding a story around espionage and how the intelligence community around the world has been affected after the events of 9/11. This is in stark contrast to novel like The Afghan by Fredrick Forsyth.

The book is very well researched, and as somebody who is interested in the subtle aspects of espionage and intelligence instead of the James Bond variety, I really enjoyed it."

What really took me by surprise was the sophistication of the work, considering that it was written sometime in 10CE. In my opinion, the quality of writing surpassed that of even Victorian playwrights like Shakespeare.

It was also very informative to read the translator's notes at the beginning of the book, and its references to the Natya Shastra – http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natya_Shastra, an ancient Indian treatise on the performing arts."

I also found interesting, the way the author goes back and forth in the timeline in a sort of zig-zag fashion, going forward first and then coming just a bit backwards and continuing from there.

I am not a big fan of serious contemplative fiction, but I found enough interesting stuff to carry on and complete the book."

The Mark of Vishnu by Manil Suri (fiction) and Temptations of the West by Pankaj Mishra (non fiction) are some others I can recall.

In a funny, irreverant but hard-hitting account of a man from rural Bihar, Aravind Adiga exposes the utter callousness that exists about basic human dignity and quality of life, outside the glamour and affluence of the big cities. This is the India where rampant corruption, and the evils of the caste system combine to create a wretched existence for most people who live inside it.

A review by Kevin Rushby in the Guardian said : “My hunch is that this is fundamentally an outsider's view and a superficial one. There are so many other alternative Indias out there, uncontacted and unheard.”

I can assure Mr. Rushby that the picture that Adiga paints is anything but superficial. It is just that the rich, and the rising middle class choose to ignore the ‘alternative India’ that exists right outside the comforts of their compounded enclaves.

The only reason I gave the book 4 stars was because of a small bit in between which was bit of a drag."

One oh his very influential earlier writings is an essay titled ‘Power Laws, Weblogs, and Inequality’ and it is available here : http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html

In this books, he provides sharp and clear insights about how technology is changing the way groups interact with each other. Along the way he uses the examples of Wikipedia, Meetup.com, Twitter etc and provides fresh analysis of what social tools are all about and how they affect the way we live our lives."

Guha's book is significant because it talks about the events and people after independence, a piece of history which has been largely ignored, especially by the current 20-30 year olds, the largest portion of India's population and the movers and shakers of tomorrow.

Every Indian needs to read this book, to understand and acknowledge the extraordinary efforts of politicians and bureaucrats who were there at the beginning and who against all odds shaped India into a modern, democratic nation state that it is today.

Despite all the exasperation that I (as many others) feel at being an Indian citizen and dealing with the day-to-day difficulties of living (or surviving) in modern India, this book makes me proud to be an Indian."
