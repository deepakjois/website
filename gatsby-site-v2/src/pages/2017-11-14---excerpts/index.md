`gatsby-transformer-remark` allows you to get an excerpt from a markdown post. By default, it will prune the first 140 characters, but you can optionally specify a `pruneLength` in the graphql query.

```graphql
{
  allMarkdownRemark {
    edges {
      node {
        excerpt(pruneLength: 280)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also manually mark in your markdown where to stop excerptingâ€”similar to Jekyl. `gatsby-transformer-remark` uses [gray-matter]() to parse markdown frontmatter, so you can specify an excerpt_separator, as well as any of the other options mentioned [here](), in the `gatsby-config.js` file.

```json
{
  resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
  options: {
    excerpt_separator: `<!-- end -->`
  }
}
```

Any file that does not have the given excerpt_separator will fall back to the default pruning method.

You can see the results [here](/excerpt-example)
