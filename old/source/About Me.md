Not too long ago, I was a professional computer programmer. I worked at [Amazon][amazon] and [Soundcloud][soundcloud] among other places. I am currently on an extended break away from the tech bubble.

One of the motivations to run this site is to write more. I appreciate receiving any suggestions or criticisms. You can send me [anonymous feedback][feedback], or email me.
