title: Analog Data Visualisation â€“ Accounts
published: 2015-04-06
lead: Analog data visualisation experiment containing monthly food accounts with the local cafe.
---

I decided to try this out, inspired by the awesome data drawings at [Dear Data](http://www.dear-data.com/).

This is a visualisation of the money I spent consuming snacks, tea and food at a local cafe in the March 2015. It does not actually contain any drawings, but instead contains text written in different colors and organised in a grid.

In the front, there are entries organised by the day of the month. Each day of the month is written in black ink. The color of the entry denotes the kind of food item it is (red for *chai*, pink for snacks and green for meals). Totals are shown in blue. This makes it easy to scan the list quickly and estimate how many times in the month I consumed each kind of food item. The totals for each kind of food item are then tabulated at the back, and we make sure that the total amount adds up to the same on both lists.
