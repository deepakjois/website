## Introduction

[Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar][ambedkar] led what was possibly South Asia’s biggest social revolution in 2500 years. Yet, if you read the textbooks used to teach modern history in Indian schools, he appears to be little more than a sidekick to the more towering figures of Gandhi and Nehru. He is usually mentioned, quite briefly, as having played an important role in the framing of the constitution, and as a leader of the people belonging to the lowest rung of the caste system - the ‘untouchables’ or [dalits][]. What is never brought out is his seminal role, through decades of tireless endeavour, in restoring some humanity in a society which had been defined by despicable forms of discrimination and violence for close to two millennia. The achievements of the Congress-led national movement undoubtedly pale in comparison.

Ambedkar’s battle was for something much more fundamental than the Congress' objective of forming a politically independent nation state. Being a dalit himself, he knew that a victory for the national movement would mean nothing if India's majority lower-caste population continued to slave under the hegemony of upper-caste elites in the 'free' nation of India. In fact, he compared it with wanting to “build a palace on a dung heap”. As a result, he made it his life’s mission to work towards breaking the fetters of caste, and in the process inspired millions of people belonging to India's 'Depressed Classes' to fight and take control of their destiny. His battle was, in his own words, "a battle for the reclamation of human personality".

Ambedkar was also one of the most erudite and articulate scholars of his time, who received training in Economics, Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology at Columbia University, and later studied Law at Gray’s Inn, London while working on his doctoral thesis at the London School of Economics. He has written on a wide range of topics concerning Indian social, political, economic, cultural and religious life. Most of what he wrote, including numerous books, academic papers, magazine articles, speeches and legislative debates are freely available online. To begin to read Ambedkar for an upper-caste Indian such as myself, is to start a long and difficult process of unlearning – unlearning so much of what I thought I understood about India’s history, politics, culture and religions; about poverty, exploitation and inequality; about feminism, communism and Gandhism; and even about myself. 

## Books

### Annihilation of Caste
The best introduction to Ambedkar's writings is, no doubt, the seminal text [Annihilation of Caste][aoc]. Written in the form of a speech, which was meant to be delivered at a conference that never happened (the irreverence of what Ambedkar was planning to say made the organisers uncomfortable enough to cancel the event outright), it is a scathing indictment of the caste system and a call for a revolution within Hindu society. Ambedkar covers a range of issues, from the problems and failures of the upper-caste Hindu reform movement, to the root causes of social inequality and discrimination among Hindus. His arguments are sharp, logical and incisive, and he invokes several creative analogies and examples to illustrate his points, which make the text expectionally powerful and engaging.

### Castes in India: Their Genesis, Mechanisms and Development
Ambedkar presented an academic paper titled [Castes in India: Their Genesis, Mechanisms and Development][cii], while he was still a young student at Columbia. This paper is remarkable because it presents what is possibly the very first feminist analysis of caste system. Putting the upper-caste Hindu woman at the centre of his thesis, Ambedkar argues that the caste system was created, preserved and propagated primarily through the oppression and control of women. Since endogamy is the defining feature of caste, it is essential that women be controlled sexually and physically, in order to preserve it. This is what led to the emergence of a range of misogynistic social practices among upper-caste Hindus, such as sati, child marriage and forced widowhood.

### The Untouchables: Who They Were and How They Became Untouchable
Ambedkar also wrote a number of books on Indian history, challenging the Brahminical and colonialist interpretations posited by the influential historians of his time. He gives an interesting account of how untouchability may have originated in his book: [The Untouchables: Who They Were and How They Became Untouchable][the-untouchables]. In it he presents what is called the *Broken Man Theory*, which states that untouchables were originally members of nomadic tribes who were forced to settle outside sedentary villages when their tribes were defeated in battle. The theory goes on to connect the consumption of dead cattle and the spread of Buddhism among these people, with the imposition of untouchability on them by the upper-castes. Pre-empting criticism that his theory is not backed by sufficient historical evidence, Ambedkar said:

> "The present attempt to explain the origin of Untouchability...[is a] task...analogous to that of the archaeologist who constructs a city from broken stones...In this sense the book is a work of art even more than of history. The origin of Untouchability lies buried in a dead past which nobody knows. To make it alive is like an attempt to reclaim to history a city which has been dead since ages past and present it as it was in its original condition. It cannot but be that imagination and hypothesis should pay a large part in such a work."

By presenting untouchability as something which was imposed on an innocent people through cunning and deceit, and out of a lust for power, Ambedkar sought to bring a radical change in the mindset of communities which, due to centuries of servitude, accepted their low status in society as their fate. His assertion was that they had not always been slaves, and there was no reason why they should continue to be.

### What the Congress and Gandhi have Done to the Untouchables
Ambedkar’s relationship with the Indian National Congress, which was dominated by [savarna][] Hindus, was strained at best and antagonistic at worst. In the 1920’s when Ambedkar first entered the political arena, the Congress, led by Mohandas Gandhi, had begun to aggressively pursue its ideal of *Swaraj* or self-rule, and was gaining mass support. Ambedkar was one of the very few influential people of his time who dared to openly criticise the actions of Gandhi and the Congress at the height of their powers. According to him they were opportunists and hypocrites, who only pretended to care about the untouchables, while being primarily concerned with acquiring political power. In his book [What the Congress and Gandhi have Done to the Untouchables][congress-gandhi-untouchables], Ambedkar doesn’t mince words, and often leaves you reeling from the utter irreverence of his statements. He compares the Congress to a “tyrant who is held down and who pleads for liberty because he wants to regain his right to oppress”, and says that “the very idea of political power to the Untouchables is hateful to Mr. Gandhi”. These opinions are not left unsubstantiated. The book carefully traces the history of the Congress’ engagement with pressing social issues such as caste and untouchability, offering ample evidence of the hypocritical shifts in its attitude towards them, and the wide chasm between their words and actions when it came to the upliftment of the untouchables.
