## Software

### Dhun

[Dhun] is a minimalist, commandline music player for OS X. I wrote this while
reading some chapters of the brilliant book [OS X Internals][osxinternals].
Dhun uses C-based libraries to handle audio playback and Spotlight querying on
OS X. The rest of the code is written in Ruby.

inspired by another Ruby based graphing library called [Gruff][gruff]. Visit

### Tabbie

Aditya Krishnan and me were the original creators of [Tabbie][tabbie], an open source
Tab Software for British Parliamentary style debating tournaments. It was
first used in NTU Worlds 2004.

Apart from NTU Worlds 2004, Tabbie has been [used in many tournaments][tabbie_cust] around
the world, including two World Universities Debating tournaments in Vancouver
(2006) and Bangkok (2008).

### Gnome Wallpaper Changer

_This code is no longer being maintained_.

A long time ago [I wrote a script][oldblogpost] to change/cycle wallpapers
automatically in Gnome on Ubuntu Linux. I put up the code on a post on my old
blog. A couple of people even contributed a few variants to it.
