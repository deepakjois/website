## Software

### Dhun

[Dhun] is a minimalist, commandline music player for OS X. I wrote this while
reading some chapters of the brilliant book [OS X Internals][osxinternals].
Dhun uses C-based libraries to handle audio playback and Spotlight querying on
OS X. The rest of the code is written in Ruby.

### hs-gchart

**hs-gchart** is a Ruby wrapper around the [Google Chart API][gchartapi]. I
wrote this to get a better grip on [Haskell], and also to make up for
abandoning [gchartrb].

*hs-gchart* makes use of Haskellâ€™s powerful type system to come up with a rich
[data model](GChartTypes) for the Google Chart API parameters, which can then
be easily encoded into a querystring URL.

### Tabbie

Aditya Krishnan and I were the original creators of [Tabbie][tabbie], an open source
Tab Software for British Parliamentary style debating tournaments. It was
first used in NTU Worlds 2004.

Apart from NTU Worlds 2004, Tabbie has been [used in many tournaments][tabbie_cust] around
the world, including two World Universities Debating tournaments in Vancouver
(2006) and Bangkok (2008).

Klaas Van Schelven is the current maintainer of Tabbie.

### gchartrb
	  
_This project is currently unmaintained_.

You can fork [the code][gchartrb] on GitHub and do what you like with it.

**gchartrb** is a Ruby wrapper around the [Google Chart API][gchartapi]. It is
inspired by another Ruby based graphing library called [Gruff][gruff]. Visit
the website for more information.

### Gnome Wallpaper Changer

_This code is no longer being maintained_.

A long time ago [I wrote a script][oldblogpost] to change/cycle wallpapers
automatically in Gnome on Ubuntu Linux. I put up the code on a post on my old
blog. A couple of people even contributed a few variants to it.
