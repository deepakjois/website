## Software <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Coding

This site used to be generated using [Jekyll], but I switched to using [yst]
later because of its superior Markdown support (via [Pandoc]) and its ability
to handle multiple formats which I intend to use sometime soon. The website
codebase is [hosted on Github][site_gh]. You can view the source [in Markdown
format][colophon-src] (with Pandoc extensions) that is formatted into this
page.

[HTML 5] markup is used throughout.

## Design

This site was designed in collaboration with [Nimbupani Designs]. The primary
goal of the design process was to keep things minimal. However, special
attention was paid to the typography.

[Nimbupani Designs]: http://nimbupani.com

Design inspiration came from the following sources:

  * [The Elements of Typographic Style](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326) by Robert Bringhurst
  * [Administrative Debris](http://tomayko.com/writings/administrative-debris) by Ryan Tomayko
  
Some things I incorporated in the typography, which might be of interest :
	
  * [Vertical Rhythm](http://webtypography.net/Rhythm_and_Proportion/Vertical_Motion/2.2.2/)
  * [Use the best available ampersand](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2008/08/14/ampersands.html)
  * [Typographic Marks Unknown](http://www.retinart.net/typography/marksunknown) 
    (from where I picked up the hedera between the menu items)

## Browser Compatibility

This site is tested with and optimized for Firefox, Safari/Chrome and Opera. I
try to make it readable in IE7. If you are using IE 6, donâ€™t even bother
visiting this site.
