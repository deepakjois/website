Not too long ago, I was a professional computer programmer. I worked at [Amazon][amazon] and [Soundcloud][soundcloud] among other places. I am currently on an extended break away from the tech bubble.

Nowadays, I am learning [Urdu][urdu].

One of the motivations to run this site is to put more of my thoughts down in writing. This will hopefully lead to an improvement in my ability to write well. I appreciate receiving any suggestions or criticisms. You can send me [anonymous feedback][feedback].
