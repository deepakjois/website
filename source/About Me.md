Not too long ago, I used to work as a professional computer programmer. I worked at [Amazon][amazon] and [Soundcloud][soundcloud] among other places. I am currently on an extended break away from the tech bubble.

I recently started learning [Urdu][urdu].

I suffer from a lack of focus,

My writing skills suck, which is something I am trying to fix. One of the motivations to run this site is to put more of my thoughts down in writing. I appreciate receiving any suggestions or criticisms. You can send me [anonymous feedback][feedback].
