Not too long ago, I used to work as a professional computer programmer. I worked at [Amazon][amazon] and [Soundcloud][soundcloud] among other places. I am currently on an extended break away from the tech bubble.

I recently started learning [Urdu][urdu].

One of the motivations to run this site is to put more of my thoughts down in writing. This should hopefully lead to an improvement in my writing skills. I appreciate receiving any suggestions or criticisms. You can send me [anonymous feedback][feedback].
