### Linguicide (Case for Revival)

* In Aboriginal spirituality, language is the mouth of the people, but also the mouth of the land.
* When you lose your language, you lose your cultural autonomy, intellectual sovereignity, heritage.
* Many reasons to save a language: ethical, aesthetic and utilitarian
    - Ethical
        - “Linguicide”: language killing
        - “Glottophagy”: language eating
        - _“The natives would be sooner civilised if their language was extinct. The children taught would afterwards mix only with whites, where their own language would be of no use. The use of their language would preserve their prejudices and debasement, and their language was not sufficient to express the ideas of civilised life.”_ – Anthony Forster, a South Australian 19th century financier and politician on 8 September 1843.
        - _“…the ruder languages disappear successively and the tongue of England alone is heard around.”_ – George Grey, Governor of South Australia, 1841
        - Out of 330 known Aboriginal languages, only 13 (4%) are spoken natively by children.
        - Approx. 7000 languages are currently spoken worldwide.
        - Approx. 96% of the world's population speaks around 4% of the world’s languages, leaveing the vast majority vulnerable to extinction.
        - Language reclamation increases feelings of well-being and pride amongst disempowered people.
    - Aesthetic
        - _“When you lose a language, you lose a culture, intellectual wealth, a work of art. It's like dropping a bomb on a museum, the Louvre.”_ – Ken Hale, linguist at MIT
        - Languages store the cultural practices and beliefs of an entire people. Through language empowerment and reclamation, we can keep important cultural practices and concepts alive.
    - Economic
        - “Aboriginal Language Knowledge and Youth Suicide” in journal Cognitive Development – clear correlation between youth suicide and lack of conversational knowledge.
        - Language revival can have empowering effects on community well-being, providing them with a strong sense of pride and identity.
        - Cognitive advantages – multilingualism makes you clever

### Revivalistics (New Trans-disciplinary Field of Enquiry

* Revivalistics studies comparatively and systematically the universal constraints and the global mechanisms, on the one hand, and the particularistic peculiarities and cultural relativist idiosyncrasies, on the other hand, that are apparent in linguistic reclamation, revitalization, and reinvigoration attempts across various sociological backgrounds all over the globe.
* Spectrum of language revival:
    - Reclamation
        - No native speakers of the language, when the revival began
        - e.g. Hebrew, Kaurna (the Aboriginal language of Adelaide, Australia), Barngala, Wampanoag, Siraya, Myaamia.
        - Mechanisms: Reclamation Workshops,
    - Revivalization
        - Severely endangered languages.
        - Some speakers
        - e.g. Adnyamathanha, Karuk, Walmajarri.
        * Mechanisms: Master/Apprentice, Promoting translation and interpretation
    - Reinvigoration
        * Endangered.
        * Many speakers.
        * e.g. Welsh, Irish, Catalan, Quebocoise French
        - Mechanisms: Comprehensive education, Total immersion
* Common revivalistic mechanisms:
    - Neologize – coin new words for new concepts, e.g. phono-semitic matching
    - Media and new media
    - Linguistic Landscape (Langscape)
    - Toponyms (place names)
    - Language camps and classes
    - Expanding domains of use (road signs, signage etc.)
    - Cultural tourism, music, songs etc.
* Revivalistics is trans-disciplinary, what does that mean?
    - Disciplinary – Limited to specific discipline, e.g. economics
    - Multi-Disciplinary – More than one discipline, say economics and law, but with no cross fertilization
    - Inter-Disciplinary – is when you answer question from chemistry using say, physics.
    - Transdisciplinary - is then the question itself, not only the answer arises from the very interface between different disciplines.
* Revivalistics is trans-disciplinary because it studies language revival from various angles, such as law, mental health, education, linguistics indeed, anthropology, sociology, geography, politics, history, biology, evolution, genetics, genomics, colonisation studies for example, missionary studies, media, technology, talknology (that is talk plus technology, digital communication, the new media), archaeology, meteorology, theatre, dance, music, and even architecture.
* Revivalistics vs. Documentary Linguistics
    - Documentary Linguistics cares about the language, its grammar and lexicon/vocabulary
    - Revivalistics puts the native speakers, rather than the language at the very centre. Revivalists ought to work with a community.
* A revivalist cannot be:
    - An armchair linguist who sits at home and analyses language
    - A veranda linguist who observes the natives without engaging them
    - A caravan linguist who interrogates a native speaker in a caravan until the native speaker faints out of exhaustion
 * Purism vs Compromise
    - Revivalistics can assist Indigenous communities in a realistic, non-puristic way, without selling them myths. Revivalistics discards an “imprisoning purism prism”. It makes the community members realise that “shift” happens, which can be a good thing.
