### The Invisible Hand - Adam Smith
* Champion of free markets.
* Conditions of a free market rarely exist in practise.
* What about power and size?
* What about people who fall below the equilibrium.


### Utilitarianism - Jeremy Bentham
* Utilitarianism

### Relative Backwardness - Alexander Gerschenkron
* 1904-1978
* In 19th Century Europe not all countries industrialized in the same way.
* A backward country can apply the latest tech, the growth would be more sudden and faster than that of a pioneer country
* His ideas have made a transition into developmental economics
    - Leapfrogging tech
    - Resource substitutes
    * Transitory role of state
* Examples: Post-war Japan, Korea and now, China

### Classical Liberalism - Friedrich August von Hayek
* 1899-1992
* Rights of the individual as a counterbalance to the encroachment of Communism and post-war planning
* All planning, regardless of intention was co-ercive, and hence was inferior to the market as an allocative mechanism between individuals
* The task of govt. should be limited to what individuals could not do themselves
* Economic freedom should take precedence over political freedom, becaise political freedom could lead to the election of a democratic govt. that could still erode individual liberty in the economic sphere

### Keynesianism - John Maynard Keynes
* 1883-1946
* General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
* Left alone, the economy might not bounce back, but instead settle down at a lower equilibrium, leading to mass unemployment
* Advocated increased govt. spending
* Countercyclical:  govt. spends more when demand was falling and spent less when demand was booming
* Dominated during post WW
* Went out of fashin in 1970s
    - Less compatible
    - Less relevant in an increasingly globalized economy

### Critical Political Economy - Robert Cox
* 1926-
* Worked with ILO, and became pessimistic about large bureaucracies
* States were hegemonic and social constructions by the leading elites, and were just one of other social and cultural forces. Hence he rejected a purely state-centric approach.

### Problem Solvers vs Critical Theorists
#### Problem Solvers
* Stand inside the framework, take the world as they find it and work within its framework
* Use available institutions to solve problems
* Deal with problems individually, therefore they have a fragmented approach
* Historical, regarding the system as a immutable at least in the short term
* Use theories to fit comfortably within the existing order
* _Conservative_, perpetuate existing order

#### Critical Theorists
* Start outside the order and ask how it came about
* Question the power relations represented by them and analyze their underlying change
* Critical Theorists look at the system as a whole
* See the past as past of the dynamism of change
* Posit alternatives and more desirable scenarios
* Provide guide to an alternative world order

### The Take Off - Walt W. Rostow

### Marxism - Karl Marx

### Small States - Peter Katzenstein
