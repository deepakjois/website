### The Invisible Hand - Adam Smith
* Champion of free markets.
* Conditions of a free market rarely exist in practise.
* What about power and size?
* What about people who fall below the equilibrium.


### Utilitarianism - Jeremy Bentham
* Utilitarianism

### Relative Backwardness - Alexander Gerschenkron
* 1904-1978
* In 19th Century Europe not all countries industrialized in the same way.
* A backward country can apply the latest tech, the growth would be more sudden and faster than that of a pioneer country
* His ideas have made a transition into developmental economics
    - Leapfrogging tech
    - Resource substitutes
    * Transitory role of state
* Examples: Post-war Japan, Korea and now, China

### Classical Liberalism - Friedrich August von Hayek
* 1899-1992
* Rights of the individual as a counterbalance to the encroachment of Communism and post-war planning
* All planning, regardless of intention was co-ercive, and hence was inferior to the market as an allocative mechanism between individuals
* The task of govt. should be limited to what individuals could not do themselves
* Economic freedom should take precedence over political freedom, becaise political freedom could lead to the election of a democratic govt. that could still erode individual liberty in the economic sphere

### Keynesianism - John Maynard Keynes
* 1883-1946
* General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
* Left alone, the economy might not bounce back, but instead settle down at a lower equilibrium, leading to mass unemployment
* Advocated increased govt. spending
* Countercyclical:  govt. spends more when demand was falling and spent less when demand was booming
* Dominated during post WW
* Went out of fashin in 1970s
    - Less compatible
    - Less relevant in an increasingly globalized economy

### Critical Political Economy - Robert Cox
* 1926-
* Worked with ILO, and became pessimistic about large bureaucracies
* States were hegemonic and social constructions by the leading elites, and were just one of other social and cultural forces. Hence he rejected a purely state-centric approach.

### Problem Solvers vs Critical Theorists
#### Problem Solvers
* Stand inside the framework, take the world as they find it and work within its framework
* Use available institutions to solve problems
* Deal with problems individually, therefore they have a fragmented approach
* Historical, regarding the system as a immutable at least in the short term
* Use theories to fit comfortably within the existing order
* _Conservative_, perpetuate existing order

#### Critical Theorists
* Start outside the order and ask how it came about
* Question the power relations represented by them and analyze their underlying change
* Critical Theorists look at the system as a whole
* See the past as past of the dynamism of change
* Posit alternatives and more desirable scenarios
* Provide guide to an alternative world order

### The Take Off - Walt W. Rostow
* 1916-2003
* Wrote The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto
* All societies were eventually destined to press through stages of economic growth
    - Traditional Society
    * Precondition Phase
    * Take-off
    * Maturity
    * Mass Consumption
* Thoroughly discredited eventually, but even today there are economists who take it seriously

### Marxism - Karl Marx
* Fusion of Hegelian Philosophy and Empirical Study on the state of society
* Hegel’s ideology: Any current situation contained contradictions, and the resolution of there contradictions moves society to a new level
* Dialectic Materialism: Class Struggle
* Criticism of Marx’s Ideology
    - Capitalism has survived many crises
    * Technological advance postponed the falling rate of profit
    * Proletariat contines to be deceived by false identities, as they would call it
    * In the cases where power difference ??? from the hands of the bourgeoise, the lasting benefits of Communism were hard to find

### Small States - Peter Katzenstein
* 1945-
* Interesting work – Small States in World Markets: Industrial Policy in Europe (1985)
    - Analysis of small states in Europe like Denmark, Sweden, Australia, Netherlands etc.

### World Systems Theory - Immanuel Wallerstein
* The Modern World System Vol. I-IV
    - Divides economics into two types: core and periphery
    - Capitalists of both core and periphery exploit their workers
    - They share an identity of interest, and therefore conspire to maintain a system from which both sides profit, although they may compete for power within these structures.

### New Institutional Economics- Ronald Coase
* 1910-2013
* An amalgam of separate ideas that have slowly coalsced into a supporting framework for the mainstream neo-classical focus
* Transaction costs from firms
* Social costs, the impact of property rights and their
    - Transaction costs low, property rights are relatively unimportant
    - But when they are high, property rights are important in determining time horizon for output planning
* Here are winners and losers in institutional change
* Markets are not academic abstractions, but political constructions

### Economic Structuralism- Raúl Prebisch
* Structurally, the prices of primary products tend to decline relative to those of manufactured costs
* Therefore, benefits of international trade tended to go to industrial countries, which is an inevitable consequences of the nature of production
* Advocated heavy industrialisation, import substitution
* Ideas discredited during the Latin American Debt Crisis of 1985
