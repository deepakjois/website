## Week 1

* Three dimensions along which animal communication and human communication is different
    - Discrete Infinity: *discrete* – limited or countable; language is infinite
    - Displacement: in time (past, present and future), in space
    - Joint
        * expresses a shared goal
        * language is inherently co-operative
* Does every human being have a language?
* Language
    - Native Speakers
    - Speak about everything
    - Recognizable by a group as their language
* Sign Language
    - System
    - Just like spoken languages
    - Variation
    - Functionality
    - Native Speakers
* **Aphasia**: The (partial) loss of language due to brain damage.
* Evolution of Languages
     - Continuity based theories: e.g. Tomasello, Pinker
     - Discontinuity based theories: e.g. Chomsky. See [here](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/rapid-rise-human-language-0331) for an article w/ more details.
* Natural Language = Native Speakers
* William Lobov (famous American Sociolinguist) once said linguists work in 5 different places:
    (@) Library
        - Reference: Books, Internet
        - Historical Linguistics
        - Philology (How is language used in literary works)
    (@) Bush
        - Study new languages in remote locations
    (@) Closet
        - Write/Think; Theoretical Linguistics
    (@) Laboratory
        - Phonetics/Speech Sounds
        - Psycholinguistics
        - Brain Scanning
    (@) Street
        - Small variation
* Victoria Nyst Interview
    - Phonology in Sign Language linguistics
    - “Parameters” e.g. handshakes, orientation of hand, location of hand

## Week 2

* Two subdisciplines of Linguistics
    - Phonetics: Studies physical and physiological aspects of sounds
    - Phonology: Studies sounds as part of language, omitting linguistically irrelevant details

* Sounds
  - Form finite set
  - ± 20-200 vowels and consonants
  - Building blocks for constructing words

* International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
    - All different sounds
    - All different languages

### Consonants

[Table of English Consonants](https://www.google.com/search?q=table+of+english+consonants)

* Distinguising consonants from vowels
    - Airstream is not impeded for vowels
    - Every syllable has a vowel; consonants are optional

Three dimensions:

- Place of articulation
     * Labial (lips)
     * Alveolar ([alveolar ridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge))
     * Velar (back part of the mouth)
     * Other? (for e.g. somewhere around the vocal cords, for e.g the Urdu ‘خ’ sound)
* Manner or articulation
     - Stop/Plosive (प)
     - Fricative (फ)
     * Nasal (म)
     * Sonorant (ल)
* Voicing
     * Vocal cords

* Some consonants that occur is (almost) all languages: T and M
* Consonants reveal word meaning
* Southern African languages have the most consonants (100-150)

### Sounds in systems

* In phonology, the dimensions we discussed above are called _features_
* Assumption: Sounds are constituted of features. The true atoms of language are just those _features_
* Evidence Type 1: Phonological Activity
    - Sound A → B or Feature A → B
* Evidence Type 2: Symmetry of Consonants
    - Hawaiian : ‘t’ and ‘k’ mean the same thing
* Evidence Type 3: Path of Acquisition
    - Children learn sounds ’p’ and ‘t’ (voiceless, plosive, labial and coronal)
    * Then they learn nasal: m-n
    * Then they learn fricatives: f-s
    * They don’t learn sounds one at a time, they learn places or articulation/manners of articulation one at a time
* Evidence Type 4: Speech errors
    * Interchanging sounds:
        - Brake fluid → Blake fruid
    * Interchanging features
        * Cedars of Lebanon → Cedars of Lemadon
        * Spaghetti → Skabetti

* Why do languages chance?
    * Internal factors: How children acquires languages from their parents and change it ever so slightly
    * External factors: Borrowings from other languages

* Nacht (German) and Night (English)
* Christmas (English) and Kalikimaka (Christmas)

## Week 3

* Words and sentences
    - Express meaning
    - **Morphology:** Study of internal structure of words
    * **Syntax:** Study of how sentences are formed out of words

### Morphology

* Criteria for words
    - Spaces
    - Meaning, one meaningful concept
    * Pronunciation, one form that cannot be interrupted
* Parts of words
    * e.g. _uncovering_
    * Three *morphemes*, un-, cover, -ing
    * Affixes: *un-* (prefix), *-ing* (suffix)
    * Base: *cover*

#### Four Types of Languages

* Isolating
    - word is one morpheme
    * few combinations
    * e.g. Chinese
    * 1:1, Morpheme:Meaning
* Agglutinative
    - Lots of morphemes
    - Transparent way of combining
    - Turkish:
        * *el* = hand
        * *el-ler* = hands
        * *el-im* = my hands
        * *el-ler-im* = my hands
* Fusional
    * e.g Arabic
    * Affix changes internal to the base
    * Example:
        - کتاب = Kitāb (Book)
        * کُتُب = Kutub (Books)
        * کاتِب = Katib (Writer)
        * کِتابت = Kitabat (to write)
* Polysynthetic
    * Combine bases and affixes endlessly
    * e.g. Mohawk


Most languages cannot be neatly classified into one category above. For e.g. Engish is

* Fusional - *sing*, *sang*, *sung*
* Isolating
* Agglutinative - *uncovering*

Do some languages have more words than others?

> Languages seem to differ in the number of words they have, but at the end of the day we cannot really count the number of words in any language and therefore we cannot really make that comparison.

### Morphology and Syntax

* Labels for words, for e.g *John eats rice*
    - Subject
        * *John*
        - performer of action
        * if subject changes, verb changes
    * Object
        * *rice*
        * other nominal thing
        * _not_ the subject
    * Verb
        * _eats_
        * describes the action
        * changes when subject changes
* Word orders (six possible)
    * SVO - English
    * SOV - Turkish, Korean
    * VSO - Tagalog
    * VOS - Malagasy
    * OSV - Xavante
    * OVS - Hixkaryana
* Longer Sentences
    * Noun Adjective order
        * NA - Abenaki
        * AN - Mising
    * Prepostion/Postposition
        * Polish has prepositions - *Na Stole* (On the table)
        * Finnish has postpositions - *Liisan kanssa* (Lisa with)
* Typologists: study correlation in word orders
    * Joseph Greenberg (1915-2001)
* Word orders
    * SVO and SOV cover 90% of languages
    * VSO cover another 8-9%
    * Subject comes before object (usually). Two kinds of hypotheses for this:
        * innate
        * logical order

## Week 4

* Meaning in language
    - What is meaning? Philosophical question
* Two layers of meaning
    - Semantic
        - is literal
    * Pragmatic
        - Why does the speaker say this
        * To inform, order or apologize etc.
            - Is about context
            - I → you

### Semantics
* _Orange_ - No precise definition of color orange
* Not all languages have word for _orange_
* Languages differ in the way they represent and talk about color
* Languages divide this world in different ways, using different categories
* Debate universals
    * Ethnocentrism (western frame)
    * Are aspects of human language universal
    * Given by human biology
    * Influenced by surrounding culture
* Debate language and thought
    * Few color terms, more difficut to distinguish colors (results of experiments mixed)
* Problems with word semantics
    * How many color terms for English?
        - Indefinite. Depends on speaker, context etc.
    * Inuit and many words for snow
    * e.g: What is a book? How do you define a book unambiguously?

### Pragmatics
* Performative meaning 1:
    - Examples:
        - I name this ship The Queen Elizabeth
        * I do take this woman…
    * Speech Acts
        * Sentences that would change the world (JL Austin)
* Performative meaning 2:
    * Making a change by _not_ saying something
    * Reference letter\
     <img src="/images/linguistics_semantics_ref_letter.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Letter slide">
    - Semantics: +ve
    * Pragmatics: -ve (She isn’t a good candidate)
* Ignoring pragmatics
    * Spouse: “I ate half of your apple pie”
        - Ate half of the pie
        * Ate the entire pie (which included half)
    * Maxims
        - Rules that participants have to obey in conversation (Paul Grice)
        * _Quantity_ – Provide just enough information
