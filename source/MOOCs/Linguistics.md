## Week 1

* Three dimensions along which animal communication and human communication is different
    - Discrete Infinity: *discrete* – limited or countable; language is infinite
    - Displacement: in time (past, present and future), in space
    - Joint
        * expresses a shared goal
        * language is inherently co-operative
* Does every human being have a language?
* Language
    - Native Speakers
    - Speak about everything
    - Recognizable by a group as their language
* Sign Language
    - System
    - Just like spoken languages
    - Variation
    - Functionality
    - Native Speakers
* **Aphasia**: The (partial) loss of language due to brain damage.
* Evolution of Languages
     - Continuity based theories: e.g. Tomasello, Pinker
     - Discontinuity based theories: e.g. Chomsky. See [here](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/rapid-rise-human-language-0331) for an article w/ more details.
* Natural Language = Native Speakers
