## Week 1

* Three dimensions along which animal communication and human communication is different
    - Discrete Infinity: *discrete* – limited or countable; language is infinite
    - Displacement: in time (past, present and future), in space
    - Joint
        * expresses a shared goal
        * language is inherently co-operative
* Does every human being have a language?
* Language
    - Native Speakers
    - Speak about everything
    - Recognizable by a group as their language
* Sign Language
    - System
    - Just like spoken languages
    - Variation
    - Functionality
    - Native Speakers
* **Aphasia**: The (partial) loss of language due to brain damage.
* Evolution of Languages
     - Continuity based theories: e.g. Tomasello, Pinker
     - Discontinuity based theories: e.g. Chomsky. See [here](http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2015/rapid-rise-human-language-0331) for an article w/ more details.
* Natural Language = Native Speakers
* William Lobov (famous American Sociolinguist) once said linguists work in 5 different places:
    (@) Library
        - Reference: Books, Internet
        - Historical Linguistics
        - Philology (How is language used in literary works)
    (@) Bush
        - Study new languages in remote locations
    (@) Closet
        - Write/Think; Theoretical Linguistics
    (@) Laboratory
        - Phonetics/Speech Sounds
        - Psycholinguistics
        - Brain Scanning
    (@) Street
        - Small variation
* Victoria Nyst Interview
    - Phonology in Sign Language linguistics
    - “Parameters” e.g. handshakes, orientation of hand, location of hand

## Week 2

* Two subdisciplines of Linguistics
    - Phonetics: Studies physical and physiological aspects of sounds
    - Phonology: Studies sounds as part of language, omitting linguistically irrelevant details

* Sounds
  - Form finite set
  - ± 20-200 vowels and consonants
  - Building blocks for constructing words

* International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)
    - All different sounds
    - All different languages

### Consonants

[Table of English Consonants](https://www.google.com/search?q=table+of+english+consonants)

* Distinguising consonants from vowels
    - Airstream is not impeded for vowels
    - Every syllable has a vowel; consonants are optional

Three dimensions:

- Place of articulation
     * Labial (lips)
     * Alveolar ([alveolar ridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge))
     * Velar (back part of the mouth)
     * Other? (for e.g. somewhere around the vocal cords, for e.g the Urdu ‘خ’ sound)
* Manner or articulation
     - Stop/Plosive (प)
     - Fricative (फ)
     * Nasal (म)
     * Sonorant (ल)
* Voicing
     * Vocal cords

* Some consonants that occur is (almost) all languages: T and M
* Consonants reveal word meaning
* Southern African languages have the most consonants (100-150)

### Sounds in systems

* In phonology, the dimensions we discussed above are called _features_
* Assumption: Sounds are constituted of features. The true atoms of language are just those _features_
* Evidence Type 1: Phonological Activity
    - Sound A → B or Feature A → B
* Evidence Type 2: Symmetry of Consonants
    - Hawaiian : ‘t’ and ‘k’ mean the same thing
* Evidence Type 3: Path of Acquisition
    - Children learn sounds ’p’ and ‘t’ (voiceless, plosive, labial and coronal)
    * Then they learn nasal: m-n
    * Then they learn fricatives: f-s
    * They don’t learn sounds one at a time, they learn places or articulation/manners of articulation one at a time
* Evidence Type 4: Speech errors
    * Interchanging sounds:
        - Brake fluid → Blake fruid
    * Interchanging features
        * Cedars of Lebanon → Cedars of Lemadon
        * Spaghetti → Skabetti

* Why do languages chance?
    * Internal factors: How children acquires languages from their parents and change it ever so slightly
    * External factors: Borrowings from other languages

* Nacht (German) and Night (English)
* Christmas (English) and Kalikimaka (Christmas)
