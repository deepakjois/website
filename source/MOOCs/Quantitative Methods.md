## Origins of the Scientific Method

### Non-scientific Methods
* Intuition/belief
* Consensus
* Authority
* Casual Observation
* Informal logic

### Scientific Method
* We need:
    - Systematic observation
    - Formal logic, consistently applied
* **Scientific Method**
    - Empirically testable
        - Obersvations and data
    - Replicable
        - Repeatedly testable
    * Objective
        - It does not matter _who_ is performing a study
        - Clear assumptions, concepts, procedures
    * Transparent
        - Replicated by anyone, publicly shared
    * Falsifiable
    * Logically consistent
        - Hypothesis internally consistent
        - Conclusion internally consistent
 * Scientific attitude
     * Critical
     * Open, transparent

### Scientific Claims
* **Observation**
    - An accurate or inaccurate representation of the world
    - Uninteresting in terms of explanatory power
    - Building blocks, but not useful on their own
* **Hypothesis/Law**
    - A statement that describes a patter or general relation b/w properties
    * Describes/explains
    * Could be strongly supported or not strongly supported
    * A _Law_ is a special type of hypothesis which is very precise in terms of facts and explanation, so precise that it is expressed in the form of a mathematical equation. Laws are generally strongly supported.
    * In social sciences, laws are hardly ever formulated. We understand too little of people or geoups with such a degree of precision that we can postulate scientific laws.
* **Theory**
    - In day to day life, a theory means an unsubstantiated statement, an educated guess.In science, it represents a broad overarching explanation of many related phenomena.
    - In the sciences, a theory is built up of strongly supported hypothesis
    * In the social sciences, a theory is considered plausible when it has withstood attempts to refute based on logical grounds, as well as historical and qualitative analysis.
    * In sciences, there is no certainty, only a provisional best explanation.

### Origins of the Scientific Method
* Classical Period
    - Plato (390 BC)
        - Knowledge of ideal forms can only be obtained by reasoning
        * Plato was a rationalist.
    * Aristotle (350 BC)
        * Empiricist
        * Realist
        * Developed formal logic, more specifically the syllogism.
        * Fundamental premises can be determined through observations of basic patterns and irregularities in the world.
    * Ptolemy (40 AD)
    * Ibn al Hasan, Al Biruni, Ibn Sina (1000 AD)
        - Systematic observation and experimentation
    * Roger Bacon (1260 AD)
        * Induction and Deduction to generate explanations
        * Induction means using particular observation to generate general explanations
        * Deduction means predicting particular outcomes based on general explanations
    * Invention of the printing press
        * Copernicus’ book (1500 AD)
        * Some people think that the Age of Enlightenment started with Copernicus.
        * Others think it started with Galileo Galilei
* The Age of Enlightenment
    * Galileo (1600 AD)
        * Father of modern science
        * Set in mothing separation of science from philosophy, ethics and theology (which were all under strict control of the Catholic Church)
        * He disproved Aristotle’s theory that heavy objects fall to the earth faster than light objects. He did this via a thought experiment.
        * He disputed the Ptolemiac view that the earth is the centre of the universe. Supported Copernicus’ Heliocentric view.
    * Descartes (1600 AD)
        * Cogito, ergo sum
        * This led him to conclude that we only know the nature of the world through reasoning
    * Francis Bacon (1600 AD)
        * Scientific knowledge should be based on first principles
        * Bacon maintained that this must happen through induction
        * Father of empiricism
    * David Hume (1740 AD)
        * Took empiricism to the extreme, accepting only sensory data as a source of knowledge and disqualifying theoritical concepts that didn’t correspond to directly observable things
        * Concluded that the true nature of reality consists of the features of objects, not the tru objects themselves.
        * This extreme for of empiricism is called _skepticism_
        * Showed the problem of induction: no guarantee that your next observation will agree with the previous ones
     * German Idealism (1830)
        * Partly in response to Hume’s skepticism
        * Idealists believe that we construct mental reality
        * Our experience of the world is a mental reconstruction
        * Scientific enquiry should therefore focus on what we can know through our own reasoning
        * Occupied themselves with questions about self, God, substance, existence, causality.
        * Criticised heavily for using obscure and overly complicated language.
        * Scientists started to lose patience with idealists and their metaphysics around the turn of the 19th century, during the second Industrial Revolution.
* Modern Science
    * Logical Positivism (1930)
        * Radical swing back to empiricism
        * Formation of the Wiener Kreis (Vienna Circle).
        * Felt idealists’ questions about the self and the meaning of existence were meaningless because they were unanswerable.
        * Science = study of meaningful statements about the world
            * Meaningful means that a statement is verifiable.
                * Analytic statements
                    * Tautological, e.g. _Bachelors are unmarried_
                    * a priori -> don’t depend on the state of the world
                    * Don’t depend on the state of the world, so don’t need observations to be verified
                    * Useful in mathematics and logic
                    * New combinations of analytic statements can be verified with formal logic
                * Synthetic statements
                    * Depend on the state of the world, e.g. _all bachelors are happy_
                    * a posteriori -> depend on the state of the world
                    * verified through observation
                    * publicly accesible
                    * verification criterion <=> problem of induction – no amount of confirmatory evidence is ever enough to definitively prove or verify statements.
                    * Hence, the strong criterion of _verification_ was weakened, to instead require only _confirmation_
                    * Entities like electron, gravity are not observable but they are indispensable in scientific explanatio. This created a problem for scientific claims.
                    * This led to a weakened form of logical positivism, called logical empiricism
    * Karl Popper
        * One of the main critics of the Vienna Circle
        * Argues that the distinction between meaningful and meaningless statements should be based on the criterion of _falsification_, not _verification_.
        * A statement is meaningful only if it is falsifiable.
        * Scientists should engage in risky experiments that maximise the chance to falsify their hypothesis
    * Willard Van Orman Quine
        * Showed that _falsification_ as a criterion is also problematic
        * Duhem-Quine thesis
            - No hypothesis can be tested in isolation
            - There are always background assumptions and supporting hypothesis
    * Thomas Kuhn
        * Science does not develop out the strict application of either the verification or the falsification principle.
        * Hypothesis are not immediately rejected if they cannot be verified or falsified
        * Science takes place within a _paradigm_. Hypothesis are generated within that paradigm. Unexpected results lead to a revision of the hypothesis but only as long as they fit the framework.
        * When a lot of contradictory evidence accumulates, a crisis occurs, which leads to a _paradigm shift_
    * Hypothetico-deductive method
        * Induction and deduction
        * Falsifiablity
        * Replication => provisional confirmation
        * Philosophically, many scientists might be much more comforable with Bas Van Fraassen’s _constructive empiricism_.
            - Science aims to produce empirically adequate theories
               * Knowledge required observation
               * Unobservables allowed
               * Scientific claim is ‘true’ only as far as the observables go 

### Philosophy of Science
* Philosophical considerations
    - What is there to know?
        - Nature of reality
        * What is real?
        * What exists?
        * Ontology – study of being
    - How can we know it?
        * What knowledge is accessible?
        * How do we access it
        * Epistemology – study of knowledge
* Epistemology
    * Rationalism
        * Knowledge is gained through reason, using our mind’s capability for logical, rational thought.
        * Innate knowledge
    * Empiricism
        * Knowledge thorough sensory experience
        * Aristotle is considered the first empiricist
            - _tabula rasa_, the blank slate – our mind is not predefined. It is open to any ideas.
        * Hume, Bacon and the logical positivists were strict empiricists.
        * van Fraassen’s _constructive empiricism_ is the contemporary flavor of empiricism.
* Ontology
    - What is the nature of reality
    - existence of external reality
        - outside?, or
        - only in mind?
    * existence of
        * particulars – specific instances
        - universals – abstract, unobservable
    - Idealism
        * Reality exists only in our mind.
        * Existence of a physical world is irrelevant, since our perception of it is determined by our mental processes
    - Materialism
        * Accepts an external world independent of our mind
        * Everything in this independent physical reality consists entirely of matter
        * Everything is a result of physical stuff interacting with each other, including our thoughts, feelings etc.
    * Realism
        * Independent reality exists
        * But Realists also maintain that universals like love and gravity are real
            * Platonic realism – universals like gravity and love really exist independent from our observation, but on a separate abstract place
            * Scientific realism
                - It is possible to make consistently supported claims using universals in statements about observable phenomena.
                - Love and gravity are given the same ontological status as observable particulars.
                - Unobservables are allowed to exist, since they are often useful
    * Nominalism
        * Opposes Realism as far as universals are concerned.
        * Denies the existence of universals
        * no such thing as gravity or love. We just make use of terms to help us make sense of the world
* Approaches
    * Ontological view
        - Realist
    * Epistemological view
        * Positivist (Empiricist)
    * Social and Psychological phenomena
        * Objectivism
            * Phenomena like intelligence, social cohesion are external, independent physical properties that exist separately from our mental representation of these properties
            * Realism, thus applies
            * Generally associated with quantitative methods in social science
        * Constructivism
            * Nature of social phenomena depends on the social actors involved
            * Reality is primarily a mental construction, it depends on the observer and the context
            * Interpretivism – an epistemological position to fit the ontological position of constructivism
                * interpretivist views assume that a researcher's experience or observation of a social phenomenon, can be very different from how the people who are involved in the social phenomenon experience themselves.
                * The focus should therefore lie with understanding the phenomenon from the point of view of the people involved.
                * Three interpretivist views
                    - Hermeneutics
                        - Term comes from the theological discipline concerned with interpretation of scripture.
                        * Aims to explain social phenomenon by interpreting people’s behavior within their social context.
                    - Phenomenology
                        - It starts from the premise that people are not inert objects. They think and feel about the world around them. And this influences their actions.
                        - To understand their actions, it's necessary to investigate the meaning that they attach to the phenomena that they experience.
                        * need to eliminate as many of one’s own preconceived notions as they possibly can.
                    - Verstehen
                        - mainly associated with sociologist Max Weber.
                        - refers to the empathic understanding of social phenomenon.
                        * Researchers need to assume the perspective of the research subjects to interpret how they see the world.
                        * researchers need to immerse themselves in the culture of the person, or the group that they're investigating.
            * Problems with the constructivist-interpretivist view
                * Layered Interpretation, more chance of misinterpretation
                * Lack of comparibility
                * Difference in frame of reference
            * Generally associated with qualitative methods in social sciences
* Goals
    - Type of knowledge
    - Purpose of knowledge
    * Universalistic research - general explanations
    * Particularistic research – explanations for particular phenomena
    * Applied research – improve human condition
    * Fundamental research – for the sake of knowing

## The Scientific Method

### Empirical Cycle
* Empirical Cycle
  - Observation -> Induction -> Deduction -> Testing -> Evaluation -> Observation (again)
* Observation
    * Observing relation in one or more instances
    - Sparks idea for hypothessis
        - pattern, unexpected event, interesting relation we want to explain
        - source not important
* Induction
    * General rule
    * Relations holds in specific cases => Relations holds in all cases
    * Inductive reasoning used to transform
* Deduction
    * Relation should hold in new instances
    * Expectation/prediction is deduced about new observations
    * Determine research setup
    * Define concepts, measurement instruments, procedures, sample
    * _Hypothesis is transformed with deductive reasoning and specification of research setup into prediction about new observations_
* Testing
    * Data collection
    * Compare data to prediction (via statistics processing)
    * desriptive statistics: summarize
    * inferential statistics: decide
    * _New data collected and with aid of statistics, compared to predictions_
* Evaluation
    * Interpret results in terms of hypothesis
    * Prediction confirmed => hypothesis provisionally supported, NOT PROVEN
    * Prediction disconfirmed
        * repeat with better research setup
        * adjust hypothesis
        * reject hypothesis (rarely)

### Criteria for evaluation of hyothesis
* Reliability
    * Replicability
* Validity
    * Hypotheised relation accurately reflects reality
    * Construct Validity
        * Do we measure/manipulate intended constructs
    * Internal Validity
        * Is the hypothesised cause actual cause of observed effect?
        * Threatened by alternative explanations (other causes)
    * External Validity
        * Generalizability

### Causality
* Four criteria
    - Cause and effect are connected
    - Cause precedes effect
    * Cause and effect covary consistently
    * Alternative explanations could be ruled out
* Causation requires correlation, however correlation does not imply causation

### Threats to internal validity
* Threatened when there is a plausible alternative explanation to the effect
* Threats due to participants
    * maturation
        * alternative explanation: natural change
        * solution: control group
    * selection
        * alternative explanation: systematic differences in participant characteristics
        * solution: random assignment
    * selection by maturation
        * alternatice explanation: systematic differences in rate of maturation
        * solution: random assignment
* Threats due to instruments
    * Low construct validity
        * systematic bias/measures another construct
        * construct validity a prerequsite for internal validity
        * valid instruments, and valid manipulation method used consistently
    * Instrumentation
        * instruments changed during course of the study
        * valid instruments, and valid manipulation method used consistently
    * Testing
        * Sensitization – measurement affects behavior
        * special design with multiple groups with/without pretest
* Threats due to artificiality
    * Experimenter expectancy
        * biasing effect researcher’s expectations
        * researcher changes behavior (unconsciously)
        * Experimenter blind design
    * Demand characteristics
        * biasing effect participant’s expectations
        * participant changes behavior (unconsciously)
        * Double blind research design
* Threats due to research setup
    * Ambiguous temporal precedence
        * Unclear if the hypothesised cause _actually_ precedes the observed effect
        * Eliminated by manipulation of cause
    * History
        * Unforseen event during study
        * provides alternative explanation
    * Mortality
        * differential dropout
        * provides alternative explanation
        * document reasons for dropout for further research

## Variables of Interest
* Construct
    - denotes property in general abstract terms
* Variable <=> constant
    * operationalized, concrete expression of construct
    * measurable/manipulable
* Independent variable
    * cause
    * explanatory
    * input
    * predictor
* Dependent variable
    * influenced by
    * the result of
    * effect
    * response
    * outcome
    * output
* Variables of interest
    * focus of hypothesis
    * provide possible alternative explanations
* Variables of disinterest
    * Confounders
        * Related to independent + dependent variables
        * Partially or entirely accounts for the relationship
        * Not account for in hypothesis
    * Control variables
        * likely to be related to independent + dependent variables
        * effects can be controlled for (unlike confounder)
    * Background variables
        - not relevant in relation between independent + dependent variable
        * relevant for determining representativeness
